## 💻 LeetCode Problem

**🆔 Problem #21 — [Merge Two Sorted Lists]**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into **one sorted list** and return the head of the merged list.

The list should be made by **splicing together the nodes of the first two lists**.

## ✅ Example

### Input Lists:
list1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
list2: 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10


### Output (Merged List):
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


---

## 🧪 Printed Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Time          | O(n + m)  |
| Space         | O(1)      |

- `n` is the length of `list1`
- `m` is the length of `list2`
- Space is constant since we’re **reusing existing nodes**
