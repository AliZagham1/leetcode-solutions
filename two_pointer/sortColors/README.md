🧩 LeetCode Problem #75 — Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)
# 📘 Description

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We use the integers:

0 ---- red

1 ---- white

2 ---- blue

You must solve this problem without using the library’s sort function.

# 💡 Example 1

Input:

nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output:

[0,0,1,1,2,2]

# 💡 Example 2

Input:

nums = [2,0,1]

Output:

[0,1,2]
