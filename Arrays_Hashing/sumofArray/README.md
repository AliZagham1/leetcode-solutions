## ðŸ§  Why This Problem Matters

This is a **fundamental problem** in programming and algorithmic thinking. It helps beginners:

- Understand how to **traverse arrays**
- Practice using **loops** or **built-in functions**
- Develop a strong foundation for solving more complex problems involving arrays

This question is often the **first step** before tackling problems like:

- Prefix sums  
- Subarray calculations  
- Aggregate computations in matrices
