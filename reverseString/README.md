# LeetCode 344: Reverse String

## Problem Description

Write a function that reverses a string.  
The input string is given as a character array `s`.  
You must do this by modifying the input array **in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

---

### Example 1

**Input:**
s = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']


---

## Printed Output

For the input `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`,  
the printed output after reversal will be:
o
l
l
e
h


---

## Result

The function modifies the given array in-place.  
No new array or string is returned.

---

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**, where n is the length of the array.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**, since reversal is done in-place.
